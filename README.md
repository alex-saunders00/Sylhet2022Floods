## Description of the code
The code is divided into the following sections:
* Data Preparation (folder "prep")
* Data Analysis (folder "analysis")
* Results Analysis (folder "results")

Functions used throughout the sections are stored in the folder "helpers".

Thanks and credit to Jonathan Giezendanner who created the codes to run the Thomas et al. (2023) algorithm, which were adopted from the original code by Mitchell Thomas.
